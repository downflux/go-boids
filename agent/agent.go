// Package agent provides an interface for a non-holonomic robot used for the
// Boid simulation.
//
// We are modeling this robot with a maximum speed and angular velocity, which
// means the robot will have a non-zero turning radius. This should lead to
// smoother movement over naive disks, which tend to have very "jerky" behavior
// due to the lack of limit on angular velocity.
//
// We model the agent as a uniform disk which is turning about its center of
// mass -- this means its moment of intertia I can be defined as
//
//   I = 1/2 mr ** 2
//
// Note that we could also trivially redefine the "wheels" of the agent to be
// pivoting from the edge of the robot, i.e.
//
//   I = 1/3 mr ** 3, where r is the radius of the agent
//
// In this case however, the locomotion layer must take into account that
// movement will stem from the wheel well (i.e. the edge of the circle with the
// given heading) and calculate the center of mass accordingly.
